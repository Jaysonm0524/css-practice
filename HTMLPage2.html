        <h2>Car Problems</h2>

        <p1>
            My favorite hobby right now is looking things up to learn more about my car. In Particular, I've been
            looking into my engine. A mechanic told me it was broken and needed to be completely replaced. I learned
            that the timing belt was loose and it had fallen off, possibly damaging the crankshaft or another gear
            connected to the transmission. My next step is to find out what that piece is so I can find it at a junk
            yard and replace only that instead of the entire engine. That would save me over $1000.

        <h2>Videogames</h2>

        <p2>
            My next favorite thing to do is playing videogames to relax. Over the years I've built up a small collection
            of games I've played and want to play as well. At first I used a console to play most of my games since all
            of my friends had consoles. Eventually I realized that PC gamming is obviously much superior. PC has customizability
            and upgradability that console just cannot match.

        <h2>Music</h2>

        <p3>
            I recently took up the guitar and the drums. I dont have a set of drums but i have been practiving a lot of guitar.
            Mostly learning riffs and solos from rock or pop songs. The reason I initially became interested is because my
            cousin who lives in fresno moved in with us so that he could go to school in hollywood. He is studying to become
            a producer. Sometimes I watch him do his homework because it seems like he's just enjoying the instruments and sounds
            as though it were not his homework. He is very talented and I know he'll do well in school, but for now I just like
            learning from him and having my own private tutor.
